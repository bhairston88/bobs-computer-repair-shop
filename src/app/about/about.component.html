    <h1>Who We Are</h1>
    <p>Founded in 2001, Bob’s Computer Repair Shop began as a small, one-man online computer repair shop operating right out of Bob’s home.  Over the years Bob’s Computer Repair Shop built up a loyal following through reliable service and fast turnover.  Twenty years later and Bob is still going strong, now with a team of technicians dedicated to giving customers the same reliable and fast service they’ve come to expect from Bob’s Computer Repair.   </p>
